Thee didn't wan't to loseth thy headeth, so thee hadst to beest extremely careful or face the dreaded guillotine!

## Specification

The function `cake` receives an array containing only 0's and 1's and returns the size of the largest consecutive substring having exactly the same number of 0's and 1's. 

**Note:** Extra marks if your solution works with arrays up to 50,000 binary numbers. Test it with these [three examples](https://github.com/hugoferreira/golf-during-covid/tree/master/data/day5) and PM me your results.

## Examples

```
cake([]) -> 0

cake([1]) -> 0

cake([0,0]) -> 0

cake([0,1]) -> 2

cake([1,0]) -> 2

cake([0,1,0]) -> 2

cake([1,0,1]) -> 2

cake([0,1,1,0]) -> 4

cake([1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]) -> 12

cake([0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]) -> 4

cake([0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]) -> 20

cake([0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]) -> 28
```

## Solutions

### (91) Haskell by Hugo (brute-force)
```haskell
cake k=2*(foldl max 0[a|(a,b)<-(both length.partition(0==))<$>(tail.inits=<<tails k),a==b])
```

### (94) Javascript by Restivo (works with big input)
```javascript
cake=c=>{h={0:-1};m=t=0;c.map((s,i)=>{t+=s*2-1;h[t]?m=Math.max(m,i-h[t]):h[t]=''+i});return m}
```
